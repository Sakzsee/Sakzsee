- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sakzsee! <br><br>
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." <br><br>
This quote by Arthur C. Clarke perfectly captures my intrigue towards technology. The endless possibilities of marvelous time-traveling machines and utopian cities created a spark in me to become the tech-evangelist that I am today. <br><br>
However, through lived experiences and stories, I have come to realize that not all magic may be for the better good.<br><br>
I am a strong believer of Intersectionality - all the issues we face are not objective but a subjective accumulation of the past, present and future. It is our duty as humans to be kind to others, to the world, to nature and to ourselves.<br><br>
After all, all of what we are and what we learn are the same branches in the magnificent tree of the universe.<br><br>
- 👀 I’m interested in Tech policy, Full-stack Deep Learning, Adversarial Networks, & Computational Sustainability. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia & Machine learning in Cloud.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Deep-learning projects.
